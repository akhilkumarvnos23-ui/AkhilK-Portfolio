### Statement of the Problem

The Santhigiri Skill Institute website faces critical usability challenges, including:

- **Poor Navigation**: Complex menu structures and unclear information architecture
- **Lack of User Control**: Limited freedom to navigate or recover from unintended actions
- **Inadequate Error Prevention**: No feedback mechanisms for potential mistakes
- **Design Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent design patterns and functionality
- **Insufficient Help Documentation**: Limited guidance for users
- **Cluttered Layout**: Poor visual hierarchy affecting accessibility

These issues significantly impact user experience, making it difficult for visitors to navigate, find information, or complete tasks efficiently.

### Reasons for Testing

Testing and evaluation were needed to:

- **Identify Usability Issues**: Impacting navigation, error handling, and user satisfaction

- **Help and Documentation**: Insufficient guidance and support materials

**Partially Violated Heuristics:**
