## The Challenge: Manual Inspection Limitations

![Manual Inspection Challenges](/images/projects/uav/image00002.png)

Traditional infrastructure inspection methods present significant challenges:

- **Significant Risks**: Exposes workers to dangerous environments including heights, confined spaces, and hazardous materials
- **High Operational Costs**: Labor-intensive and time-consuming processes that require specialized equipment and personnel
- **Delayed Maintenance**: Lack of real-time monitoring leads to potential hazards going undetected
- **Limited Coverage**: Manual inspections can only cover a fraction of infrastructure due to physical constraints
- **Weather Dependencies**: Inspections are often delayed due to weather conditions and safety concerns
