## Overview

The maintenance and inspection of public infrastructure are critical for ensuring safety and reliability. Traditional methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and hazardous.

## The Challenge: Manual Inspection Limitations

- **Significant Risks**: Exposes workers to dangerous environments.
- **High Operational Cost**: Labor-intensive and time-consuming processes.
- **Delayed Maintenance**: Lack of real-time monitoring leads to potential hazards.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
